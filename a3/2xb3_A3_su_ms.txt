The fact that the work being submitted by me is my individual work.

Library using in this assignment:
From algorithm 4th edition text book - algs4.jar is imported in this assignment.
Data structure such as digraph, stack and etc. is imported implicitly in this assignment.

Files which is from algs4.jar but imported explictly:
BreathFirstDirectedPath.java    -use for 3.2
DepthFirstDirectedPaths.java    -use for 3.2
DijkstraSP.java                 -use for 3.4

3.2    bfs vs dfs
DigraphGenerator.java  --Read data, clean data, store all nodes
                       --generate a digraph

FindPath.java  --use DigraphGenerator.java, bfs, dfs
               --find the path by bfs and dfs


3.3    Junit
TestPath.java  --use DigraphGenerator.java, FindPath.java
               --test if the result path is valid


3.4    Shortest path
WeightCalculator.java  --calculate the weight of edge by destination city

DigraphWeiGener.java  --use WeightCalculator.java
                      --generate a digraph with weighted edge
                      --sort the menu items by price, and put into a stack

FindShortestPath.java  --use DigraphGenerator.java, DigrahWeiGener.java, dijSP
                       --find the path by dijSP

Menu.java  --ADT implements Comparable interface to store data from menu entry


4    Output specifications
Client.java  --run all the modules here
             --write the output to a3_out.txt
