The fact that the work being submitted by me is my own individual work.

Modified with Gen.java:
	create an extra for loop to generate test arrays.

Modified with Insertion.java:
	create an extra method to search in a ordered list, given the
	value v. The index indicates that v should either sits at the
	left of given index, or right.
	
Modified with all sort classes:
	create an extra method "exch" and "less" to better formalize
	the code.
	
Concerns with SortTest.java:
	SetUpBeforeClass(): reads the data from a2_in.txt, and store
	the data in a vector of vectors called data.
	
	SetUp(): Convert vectors of jobs into array of jobs.
	
	boolean isSorted(arr): return true if given array is sorted
	
	For code simplicity, I only create one local variable Job[] test
	to store an array of jobs we want to test (required in analysis).
	What I will do on my own is to change the value of the last for
	loop I added (in Gen.java), in order to get my test arrays. After
	I finished testing 2^14 array size, I will go to Gen.java and change
	the value into 2^16, thus I can use the same code in SortTest.java,
	but this time I am testing 2^16 array size.
	
	For better visualization of the elapsed time result, I use two 
	print statement in test methods. First line is the name of the
	sorting algorithm, second line is the array of elapsed time.
